## **Introduction**

Due to the design of the farming game's, graphics will be a vital component of the project.
The game will leverage two distinct perspectives, each will be utilized differently.

### **Perspectives**
- **Isometric Perspective**:
used in the overworld where it is important for the players to have the **2.5D** feel of the game environment

- **Topdown Perspective**:
used in the battle system of game where simplicity is important since the battle system will be a real-time system

> _**Note:** There will be more assets needed for the isometric perspective._


The game will also leverage a cute/charming feel to portray the game as a chill game where players think it's a typical farming game.
It is encouraged to use **[Pixel art](https://www.sandromaglione.com/articles/getting-started-with-pixel-art)** for the assets in both perspectives.
